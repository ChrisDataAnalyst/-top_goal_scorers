Hi. I'm a data analysis enthusiast. In this analysis, I try to answer the fundamental question: How to choose the best striker in the world? 
The most objective measure seems to be the ratio of matches played to goals scored.
However, a player who has played just one match and scored one goal would have a ratio of one goal per match. 
To ensure fairness, it became necessary to limit the analysis to players who have participated in at least 10 matches. Let's take a look at the data to explore this further.
